        <p class="control">
          Double TAP is lightweight testing framework where users write black box tests as rules
          checking output from tested "boxes". Boxes could be anything from http client, web server
          to messages in syslog. This universal approach allows to test anything with just dropping
          text rules describing system behavior in black box manner.
        </p>
        <p class="control">
          Following a simple example for http web server. <hr>Double TAP code:
          <pre>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: gunicorn/19.9.0</pre>
          Implementation code (the one producing output):
          <pre><code class="language-bash">curl http://httpbin.org -D - -s -o /deb/null | head</code></pre>
          Test report:
          <pre>[task stdout]
22:39:23 :: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
22:39:23 :: Date: Wed, 31 Dec 2025 19:39:23 GMT
22:39:23 :: Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
22:39:23 :: Content-Length: 9593
22:39:23 :: Connection: keep-alive
22:39:23 :: Server: gunicorn/19.9.0
[task check]
stdout match &lt;HTTP/1.1 200 OK&gt; True
stdout match &lt;Server: gunicorn/19.9.0&gt; True</pre>
          <hr>
          Double TAP checks are executed via API, given a tested output is in file data.in,
          and check is named http-gunicorn:
          <pre><code class="language-bash">curl --data-urlencode "in=@data.in"  --data-urlencode "check=http-gunicorn" http://doubletab.sparrowhub.io/check</code></pre>
          Example reply:
          <pre><code class="language-json">{
  "status": "OK",
  "report": " ... "
}</code></pre>

            Write once, use for many boxes. Tests are define "interface", which 
            could be implemented in many ways on many tested boxes. For example if write test 
            for package installation like this:
            <pre>Status: install ok installed</pre>
            <br>
            The implementation logic could be verified for many Linux distributions.
            <br><br>
            Debian/Ubuntu:
            <pre><code class="language-bash">dpkg  -s nano # stdout - Status: install ok installed</code></pre>
            <br>
            Rocky Linux:
            <pre><code class="language-bash">rpm -q  nano && echo "Status: install ok installed"</code></pre>

            <span class="tag is-black">Community driven tests</span>
            <hr> 
            With time the more people involved the more tests are available for public consumption.
            Tests are no longer embedded into hidden implementation, test driven development encourages
            other participants to implement software that passes tests, not software including tests

            <hr> 
            TAP is well known and mature protocol that is widely used in unit testing.
            The pun is to add "texting" to "testing", so we end up double T or Double TAP protocol.
            Here is the association ends. Double TAP differs from TAP, being more generic and black box testing framework. Texting means tests are based on the idea of verifying
            system behavior by checking produced text messages against set of rules.
